Create a short and exact description of the technological process of manufacturing a product based on an image providing 4 dimensions of a 3D model in JPG format. The process should be described in JSON format and include all stages of machining, starting from analysing the drawing and ending with obtaining the finished product.
Use only the following parts processing steps: turning, facing, boring, threading, drilling, reaming, milling, slotting, key-seating, broaching, heat-treatment, deburring, sand-blasting, grinding, polishing, quality-inspection, surface-coating, packaging, cutting-off, knurling, tapping, lapping, honing, burnishing, electro-discharge machining (EDM), laser cutting, waterjet cutting, assembly, marking, non-destructive testing (NDT).
The response should be JSON only, with no additional text. JSON example:

{
  "File name": "Input file name",
  "Name of operation": "Lathe",
  "Steps": [
    {"Step number": 1,
      "Action": "Name of action #1",
      "Equipment": [Name of the equipment],
      "ISO": [Name of the ISO files],
    },
    {"Step number": 2,
      "Action": "Name of action #2",
      "Equipment": [Name of the equipment],
      "ISO": [Name of the ISO files],
    },
   {
    ...
   }
  ]
}

Requirements:
(a) The description of each step should be as accurate, concise and consistent with the actual processing as possible.
(b) The equipment used must be specified with respect to the specifics of the operation.
(c) The "steps" array must cover the full process: roughing, semi-finishing, finishing, quality-inspection and packaging.
(d) The response should be JSON only, with no additional text.
